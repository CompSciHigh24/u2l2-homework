# Homework: API Exploration with Postman and PokeAPI

In this homework, you will build on what we learned in class by making additional API requests using Postman and the PokeAPI. This assignment will allow you to explore more endpoints and work with different types of data returned by the API.

## **Note: Make sure to add the response data to the JSON files in this repo**
## **Note: Commit each task with the API URL used as the message**

Example: 
```
git commit -m "https://api.random.co/generate/60"
```

## Tasks

### 1. Retrieve Pokémon Evolution Data

- Using Postman, send a GET request to retrieve the **evolution chain data for Charmander**.
- Save your result in a file called **charmanderEvolution.json**.
- Commit your work and include the URL you used in your commit message.

### 2. Find Pokémon by Habitat

- Use the PokeAPI to find Pokémon that belong to the **Cave** habitat.
- Save the list of cave-dwelling Pokémon in a file called **cavePokemon.json**.
