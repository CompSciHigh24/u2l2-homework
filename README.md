# Homework: API Exploration with Postman

In this homework, you will build on what we learned in class by making additional API requests using Postman and exploring different types of data returned by the API.

You will be Using the [Dog CEO API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/).

## **Note: Make sure to add the response data to the JSON files in this repo**

Example: 
```
git commit -m "https://api.random.co/generate/60"
```
